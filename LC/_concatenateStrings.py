Explanation

    def concatenate_strings(input_tuple): - Define a function called "concatenate_strings" that takes a tuple of strings "input_tuple" as an argument.

    return ' '.join(input_tuple) - Use the join method on a space character ' ' to concatenate the strings in the input tuple "input_tuple" with a space as the separator. Return the resulting concatenated string.

Time and Space Complexity

    def concatenate_strings(input_tuple): - Define a function called "concatenate_strings" that takes a tuple of strings "input_tuple" as an argument. No time or space complexity associated with this line as it is just a function definition.

    return ' '.join(input_tuple) - This line uses the join method on a space character ' ' to concatenate the strings in the input tuple "input_tuple" with a space as the separator. The join method has a linear time complexity O(n) because it iterates through each string in the input tuple. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new concatenated string with the length equal to the sum of the lengths of the strings in the input tuple plus the spaces in between.

The overall time complexity of the function is O(n) because it iterates through the strings in the input tuple once to create a new concatenated string. The overall space complexity is O(n) because it creates a new concatenated string with the length equal to the sum of the lengths of the strings in the input tuple plus the spaces in between.

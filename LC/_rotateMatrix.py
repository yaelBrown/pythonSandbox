  Explanation:
  
  n = len(matrix) - Get the number of rows/columns in the square matrix and store it in the variable n.

  Transpose the matrix: a. for i in range(n): - Start a loop that iterates over the rows. b. for j in range(i, n): - Start a nested loop that iterates over the columns starting from the current row i. This ensures we only swap elements in the upper triangle of the matrix, avoiding double swaps. c. matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j] - Swap the elements at positions (i, j) and (j, i).

  Reverse each row: a. for row in matrix: - Start a loop that iterates over each row in the matrix. b. row.reverse() - Reverse the elements in the current row.

  The time complexity of this code is O(n^2), as both the transpose and reverse steps involve nested loops that iterate over all the elements in the matrix. The space complexity is O(1), as the rotation is performed in-place without allocating any additional data structures.
